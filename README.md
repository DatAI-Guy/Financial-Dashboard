# Financial Project with Power BI

This repository contains information and artifacts related to my financial project developed using Power BI. The project consists of a 3-page report that includes a financial statement, a financial simulator, and a financial summary dashboard.

## Report Pages

1. Financial Statement: This page provides a detailed overview of the financial statement, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. It offers visualizations and key metrics to analyze the financial performance of the organization.

2. Financial Simulator: The financial simulator page allows users to input different scenarios and simulate their impact on financial metrics. It enables users to explore how changes in variables such as revenue, expenses, and investments affect the financial projections.

3. Financial Summary Dashboard: The financial summary dashboard provides an executive-level summary of the financial performance. It includes key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and comparisons to monitor financial health and make informed decisions.
